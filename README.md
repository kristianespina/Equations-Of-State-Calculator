Equations of State Calculator

A tool that can help you calculate cubic equations of states.

This calculator lets you calculate the compressibility factor and molar volume of fluids/gases using cubic equations of state formulas such as: Redlich-Kwong, Soave-Redlich-Kwong, Peng-Robinson, and Van der Waals.

* Instantly solves for Molar Volume and Compressibility Factor!
* Common compounds critical constants included!
* Calculation via Redlich-Kwong Equation
* Calculation via Soave-Redlich-Kwong Equation
* Calculation via Peng-Robinson
